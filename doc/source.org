** Source code structure
*** /actor.h/
This header file contains all the functions related to the actors,
including NPC and items (potions, scrolls, books, etc). All of this is
implemented as a single actor structure (struct actor) which contains
pointers to various helper structures, such as `pickable` (an item
that can be picked and used, `destructible` (an actor that can be
harmed when attacked, `attacker`, (an actor that can
attack. Intelligently or with random motives). There is also an
important `ai` helper structure, which, if the actor possesses it,
gives the wearer the ability to have intelligence, perhaps even
increasing one, such as capacity for learning.
