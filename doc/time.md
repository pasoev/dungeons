# The concept of time travel

**Innfin** is the roguelike game in the spirit of classics in the
sense that the world is procedurally generated and death is permanent,
 i.e. there is no continue from last checkpoint. There is a small catch with death, though. When you die, the next game you start will be with a different character, you will lose all skills, items, generic attributes and seemingly, you will also lose memory. Memory loss, though, is only semi-permanent. You will still have a chance to **remember** your previous character. This recollection will not restore your knowledge of spells, neither will it restore your abilities. Nevertheless, remembering one of your old characters is a crucial part of success of any of your characters. Remembering means getting better background on your character's constitution, better understanding of which direction it should develop.

 Remembering, though, can mean resuming your game in some sense, since the world in which you died continues to exist after your death. You are probably born in a different time though. Mostly in the future. You might find the place to look entirely different.
