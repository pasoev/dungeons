*Innfin - Innere Finsternis* is a horror-themed fantasy role-playing
game set in the underworld of dungeons carved into stone and earth. It
is a roguelike game in the tradition of classics of the genre like
ADOM, Nethack, Angband and others. As you play the game, you discover
various creatures in the halls and dungeons hidden from the world
above. Your goal is to choose a deity to worship and attempt to do his
or her bidding. You can abandon your god and convert to other religion
later in the game and have the objective of the game changed, as well.
